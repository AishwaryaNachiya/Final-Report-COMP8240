# Final-Report-COMP8240

## Overview
This repository contains a set of Python scripts that were utilized to generate a comprehensive dataset, stored in `extracted_data.json`. The dataset is the culmination of data extracted and processed from business details, user information, and reviews.

## Files Description

- `business.py`: This script is responsible for collecting business-related information. It structures the data into a format that can be integrated with additional data sources.

- `users.py`: This script extracts user data, processing it for demographic information, preferences, and other relevant details that contribute to the understanding of the user base.

- `reviews.py`: This script handles the extraction and processing of user reviews. It compiles ratings, textual feedback, and timestamps, providing context to the user-business interactions.

- `extracted_data.json`: This is the final output file containing the merged and processed data from the above scripts. The JSON format allows for easy integration and manipulation for further analysis or application use.

- `imdb.test.txt.ss`: Contains the testing subset of the IMDB dataset, used for evaluating the performance of sentiment analysis models.

- `imdb.train.txt.ss`: Contains the training subset of the IMDB dataset, used for training sentiment analysis models.

- `generate_pt.py` script is a Python script that processes input data and converts it into a PyTorch tensor `.pt` file format. This file format is specifically designed for PyTorch, a popular machine learning framework that allows for efficient loading and handling of training data during the model training process

- `train_both.pt`: The output file generated by this script. This file contains the processed data encoded as PyTorch tensors, ready to be used directly for training purposes in a PyTorch-based machine learning pipeline.
